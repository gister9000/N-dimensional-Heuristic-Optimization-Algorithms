# N-dimensional-Optimization-Algorithms
Implementation of various N-dimansional optimizatition algorithms such as Nelder Mead simplex, Box, axis search, gradient descent, Newton Rhapson, Hooke Jeeves etc. 

# lab1.py
Contains implementation of golden section search (with finding unimodal interval) which is used in other methods for search along an axis.

Contains implementation of Nelder Mead simplex algortihm and Hooke-Jeeves algorithm.

# lab2.py
Contains implementation of gradient descent (with calculating gradients on-the-fly), Newton-Raphson method, Box algorithm.

Also includes a method of transforming problem with limitations into a problem without limitations which can then be solved with one of the above methods.
